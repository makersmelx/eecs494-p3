Controls:

1. WASD: basic movement
2. Mouse: perspective 
3. Space: jump
4. Left shift: grab the ledge (when player is close to it)
5. Left ctrl: crouch (something is wrong with this functionality, left to be modified)

Flaws:

1. By now, it is not fun to play.
2. Controls:
   a) Mouse controling of camera seems to be not very comfortable.
   b) Camera is too easy to be inclined.
   c) Camera may be locked in some case like ledge
   d) Crouch is not correctly implemented.
