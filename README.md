# eecs494-p3

## Game Dev Note
### Controls:

1. WASD: basic movement
2. Mouse: perspective 
3. Space: jump
4. Left shift: grab the ledge (when player is close to it and is in air (e.g. after jumping))
5. Left ctrl: crouch (something is wrong with this functionality, left to be modified)

### Flaws:

1. By now, it is not fun to play.
2. Controls:
   a) Mouse controling of camera seems to be not very comfortable.
   b) Camera is too easy to be inclined.
   c) Camera may be locked in some case like ledge
   d) Crouch is not correctly implemented.
   
## Development Guide
A good practice is that for one feature that we propose, create just one issue on Jira, and create just one pull request for that on Github.
The detail guidance is moved to the wiki page [Development Guide](https://github.com/UM-Electra-Studio/eecs494-p3/wiki/Development-Guide)
